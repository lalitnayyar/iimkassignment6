2. **Analyze Data in Python:**
   - Launch `netflix_recommendation_engine.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment.
   - Follow the notebook instructions to load the MovieLens dataset, run EDA, build models, and generate visuals.
3. **Update Visuals:**
   - Save your charts as PNGs (e.g., `visual_rating_distribution.png`) in the project folder.
   - Refresh the HTML to see your updated visuals.
4. **Customize:**
   - Edit the notebook or HTML sections to tailor the analysis or presentation as needed.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **HTML Report Not Displaying Properly:**
  - Ensure you are opening the file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
  - Check that all image/chart files referenced in the HTML are present in the project folder.

- **Notebook Fails to Run:**
  - Make sure all required Python packages are installed (see Requirements above). Use `pip install package_name` as needed.
  - If dataset download fails, check your internet connection or download the MovieLens dataset manually from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/).

- **Visuals Not Updating in HTML:**
  - After saving new charts from the notebook, ensure the filenames in the HTML match your saved files.
  - Refresh the browser cache (Ctrl+F5) to see updated visuals.

- **Model Results Not as Expected:**
  - Double-check data preprocessing steps in the notebook.
  - Experiment with different model parameters or algorithms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide: Netflix Recommendation Engine & scikit-surprise

If you encounter issues while running the collaborative filtering model in the Netflix notebook, refer to the following solutions:

### Common Errors & Solutions

**1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'surprise'**
- This error means the `scikit-surprise` package is not installed.
- Solution: Install it using the command:
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-surprise
  ```

**2. Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required**
- This error occurs during installation of `scikit-surprise` on Windows, as it needs C++ build tools to compile some components.
- Solution:
  1. Download and install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
  2. During installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
  3. Restart your computer if prompted.
  4. Run the install command again:
     ```bash
     pip install scikit-surprise
     ```

**3. Still Facing Issues?**
- Try updating pip:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- Ensure you are using a compatible Python version (3.8+ is recommended).

### Alternative Approach (No scikit-surprise Required)
If you cannot install `scikit-surprise`, you can implement a simple collaborative filtering method using only `pandas` and `sklearn`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Assume ratings is your DataFrame with columns: userId, movieId, rating
user_movie_matrix = ratings.pivot_table(index='userId', columns='movieId', values='rating').fillna(0)
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_movie_matrix)
user_similarity_df = pd.DataFrame(user_similarity, index=user_movie_matrix.index, columns=user_movie_matrix.index)

# Example: Find top 5 similar users to user 1
top_similar_users = user_similarity_df.loc[1].sort_values(ascending=False)[1:6]
print("Top 5 users similar to user 1:")
print(top_similar_users)
```

This approach provides basic collaborative filtering functionality without external dependencies.

### General Tips
- Always restart your notebook/kernel after installing new packages.
- If you get persistent errors, consider creating a fresh virtual environment.
- For further help, check [scikit-surprise documentation](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or contact the course support.
