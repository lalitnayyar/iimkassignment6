## ❓ 3. Problem Statement
- Users face “choice overload” with thousands of titles available and limited time to browse.
- How can Netflix predict which movies or shows a user will enjoy, based on their past behavior and preferences?
- The system must recommend relevant content in real time, across devices and user profiles.
- Recommendations should maximize user engagement (watch time, repeat visits) and minimize churn.
- The solution must scale to millions of users and items, with low latency.
- Must address cold-start problems for new users and new content.
- Recommendations should be fair, unbiased, and respect user privacy.
- Business goal: Increase average watch time, retention, and user satisfaction while reducing churn.

## 📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Dataset:** MovieLens 20M (20 million ratings, 27,000 movies, 138,000 users)
- **Rating Distribution:**
  - Most ratings cluster between 3.0 and 4.0 stars, with a mean of ~3.5.
  - Median rating is 3.5, mode is 4.0, indicating a slight positive bias in user ratings.
  - Ratings are left-skewed; very few low ratings (below 2.0).
  - Standard deviation of ratings: ~1.0, showing moderate spread.
- **User Activity:**
  - Average ratings per user: ~144.
  - Top 1% of users contribute over 10% of all ratings (power users).
  - Long-tail distribution: majority of users rate fewer than 50 movies.
- **Movie Popularity:**
  - Most-rated movies receive over 30,000 ratings (e.g., “Forrest Gump,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Shawshank Redemption”).
  - Vast majority of movies have fewer than 1,000 ratings (long tail).
- **Temporal Trends:**
  - Ratings volume peaks on weekends and holidays.
  - New releases see a surge in ratings within the first month of availability.
  - Older movies maintain steady ratings over time due to nostalgia and classic status.
- **Visuals:**
  - [Distribution of Movie Ratings: Most ratings between 3 and 4 stars. Mean ~3.5] (Export chart as 'visual_rating_distribution.png')
  - [Top 10 Most Rated Movies: Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, etc.] (Export chart as 'visual_top_movies.png')
- **Insights:**
  - User engagement is driven by a small group of highly active users.
  - Popular movies dominate the ratings landscape, but niche content also has dedicated audiences.
  - Temporal analysis can inform marketing and release strategies.

## 🧮 5. Machine Learning Model
- Implemented collaborative filtering using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for rating prediction.
- **Training/Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing for robust validation.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~0.87 (lower is better)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~0.68
  - Baseline (random or global mean): RMSE > 1.5
- **Model Interpretation:**
  - Predicts user ratings within ±1 star for most cases.
  - Captures latent factors (user and movie features) that influence preferences.
  - Outperforms non-personalized and popularity-based baselines.
- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - SVD chosen for balance of accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.
  - Netflix production system uses advanced variants (factorization machines, deep learning, contextual bandits).
- **Scalability:**
  - Model can be parallelized and deployed at scale for millions of users and items.
  - Netflix’s real system handles billions of predictions daily with low latency.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Hybrid models (combine collaborative and content-based)
  - Real-time online learning for up-to-date recommendations
